        Hotel. Eminent Politicians discussing "shop" over their
        walnuts before dispersing for the Christmas
        holidays.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>First Eminent Politician</i>. I say that recent speech of
    yours at Skegness was a little strong. Preferring the Navy to
    the Army! Although the Army is of course the "Best possible
    Army," and all that! Eh? I say it was a little too thick!</p>

    <p><i>Second Em. Pol.</i> (<i>quickly</i>). Not a bit of it!
    You don't know how well we are getting on at Pall Mall. I give
    you my word everything's first-rate. Department working
    splendidly. You can't say that at Whitehall and Somerset
    House?</p>

    <p><i>First Em. Pol.</i> (<i>warmly</i>). Not say it! We do!
    Everything's most satisfactory. Discipline splendid. Never had
    such a fine Fleet. And the fireworks we had at the Royal Naval
    Exhibition all through the Summer! Well you ought to have seen
    them!</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/1-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/1-3.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>Second Em. Pol.</i> (<i>carelessly</i>). Yes, I daresay.
    But what have fireworks got to do with the Navy?</p>

    <p><i>First Em. Pol.</i> Why they increased our recruiting
    awfully. Fellows went to the Royal Naval Exhibition and saw all
    sorts of good things, automatic weighing machine, a
    fishing-smack, and Nelson wax-works&mdash;and&mdash;and that
    kind of thing you know, and joined the Navy! Precious good
    thing for the Service, I can tell you.</p>

    <p><i>Second Em. Pol.</i> Well, to go back to an old
    story&mdash;you can't defend the bullying on board <i>The
    Britannia</i>.</p>

    <p><i>First Em. Pol.</i> Oh, that's all bosh. Those newspaper
    fellows got hold of it for the Silly Season and ran it to
    death, but it's the best possible place in the world. No end of
    good training for a fellow to command other fellows.</p>

    <p><i>Second Em. Pol.</i> Well, they were down upon you pretty
    smartly.</p>

    <p><i>First Em. Pol.</i> (<i>airily</i>). May be. But it's
    because they didn't know what they were writing about. How can
    a fellow become a good naval officer unless he has been robbed
    of his pocket-money, and taught how to lie for his seniors.
    Thing's too ridiculous! Hallo, JIMMY, they tell me things are
    in a dreadful mess at St. Martin's-le-Grand!</p>

    <p><i>Third Em. Pol.</i> (<i>promptly</i>). Then they tell you
    wrong. Never saw anything like it&mdash;most perfect
    organisation in the world! Absolutely marvellous,
    Sir&mdash;absolutely marvellous! And the clerks so civil and
    obliging. Everybody pleased with them.</p>

    <p><i>Second Em. Pol.</i> Come, that won't do. Your statement
    is as hard to digest as too-previous turkey and premature
    plum-pudding. The papers are full of complaints all through the
    Autumn, and have only stopped recently to make room for those
    descriptive and special law reports. You will have them again,
    now Term is over.</p>

    <p><i>Third Em. Pol.</i> Who cares for the papers? I tell you
    we are absolutely inundated with letters of thanks from Dukes
    and Duchesses upwards. No; if you had said that the Colonies
    were in a mess, why then&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Fourth Em. Pol.</i> (<i>angrily</i>). What <i>are</i> you
    talking about? Why, we are absolutely romping in! Never knew
    the Colonies so prosperous as they are now! And we have had to
    put on half-a-dozen extra clerks to open and answer the letters
    of congratulation we receive hour by hour from every part of
    the Empire. Why, everything's splendid&mdash;absolutely
    splendid!</p>

    <p><i>Second Em. Pol.</i> Well, matters have decidedly mended
    since transportation was prohibited. But to return to our
    muttons. Waterloo was won&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Fourth Em. Pol.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Yes, I know,
    by the Militia and the dregs of the population! By the way,
    though, the gaols have had better company than now.</p>

    <p><i>Fifth Em. Pol.</i> Hold hard! Don't you abuse my Prisons.
    As a matter of fact, the present convicts are the finest,
    cleverest, most trustworthy fellows that ever existed. It is
    quite an honour to get into a prison nowadays. (<i>With a
    sudden burst of anger</i>.) And if any of you doubt my word,
    hang me, I will have satisfaction! (<i>Looking round for
    opponents</i>.) Come now, who will tread on the tail of my
    coat!</p>

    <p><i>Chief and Most Eminent Politician</i>. Gentlemen!
    Gentlemen! Come it's getting late, and if we are to see the
    dress-rehearsal of the Pantomime, we must be off at once!</p>

    <p>It was some time before the great-little old fellow could
    compose himself to mend the fire, and draw his chair to the
    warm hearth. But, when he had done so, and had trimmed his
    lamp, he took his "Extra Special" from his pocket, and began to
    read&mdash;carelessly at first, and skimming up and down the
    columns, but with an earnest and sad attention very soon.</p>

    <p>For this same dreadful paper re-directed <i>Punch's</i>
    thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day; thoughts
    of the sufferings of the poor, the follies of the rich, the
    sins of the wicked, the miseries of the outcast. Seasonable
    thoughts, if not exactly festive. For all is not festive, even
    at the Festive Season.</p>

    <p>Scandals in high life, starvation in low life; foul floods
    of nastiness in Law Courts; muddy tricklings of misery in
    lawless alleys; crimes so terrible and revolting; pains so
    pitiless and cureless; follies so selfish and wanton, that he
    let the journal drop, and fell back in his chair, appalled.</p>

    <p>"Unnatural and cruel, <i>Toby</i>!" he cried. "Unnatural and
    cruel! None but people who were born bad at heart&mdash;born
    bad&mdash;who had no business on the earth, could do such
    deeds. We're Bad!"</p>

    <p>The Chimes took up the words so suddenly&mdash;burst out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"
       id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span> so loud, clear, and
       sonorous&mdash;that the Bells seemed to strike him in his
       chair.</p>

    <p>And what was it that they said?</p>

    <p>"<i>Punch</i> and <i>Toby! Toby</i> and <i>Punch</i>!
    Waiting for you, <i>Toby</i> and <i>Punch</i>! Come and see us!
    Come and see us! Come and see us! Drag them to us! Haunt and
    hunt them! Haunt and hunt them. Break their slumbers! Break
    their slumbers! <i>Punch, Toby; Toby, Punch; Toby, Punch;
    Punch, Toby</i>!!" Then fiercely back to their impetuous strain
    again, and ringing in the very bricks and plaster on the
    Sanctum's walls!</p>

    <p><i>Toby</i> barked! <i>Punch</i> listened! Fancy, fancy! No,
    no! Nothing of the kind. Again, again, and yet a dozen times
    again. "Haunt and hunt them! Haunt and hunt them!"</p>

    <p>"If the tower is really open," said <i>Punch</i>, "what's to
    hinder us, <i>Toby</i>, from going up to the steeple, and
    seeing for ourselves?" "Nothing," yapped <i>Toby</i>, or sounds
    to that effect.</p>

        PLEASE, SIR, <i>OUR</i> 'OUNDS DON'T 'UNT IN 'ARD

    </div>
    <hr />

    <p>Up, up, up! and round and round; and up, up, up! higher,
    higher, higher up!</p>

    <p>There was the belfry where the ringers came. <i>Punch</i>
    caught hold of one of the frayed ropes which hung down through
    the apertures in the oaken roof. But he started; other hands
    seemed on it; he shrank from the thought of waking the deep
    Bell. The Bells themselves were higher. Higher, <i>Punch</i>
    and <i>Toby</i>, in their fascination, or working out the spell
    upon them, groped their way; until, ascending through the
    floor, and pausing, with his head raised just above its beams
    <i>Punch</i> came among the Bells. It was barely possible to
    make out their great shapes in the gloom; but there they were.
    Shadowy, and dark, and dumb.</p>

    <p>He listened, and then raised a wild "Halloa!" "Halloa!" was
    mournfully protracted by the echoes. Giddy, confused, and out
    of breath, <i>Punch</i> looked about him vacantly, and sank
    down in a swoon.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>He saw the tower, whither his charmed footsteps had brought
    him, swarming with dwarf phantoms, sprites, elfin creatures of
    the Bells. He saw them leaping, flying, dropping, pouring from
    the Bells without a pause. He saw them, round him on the
    ground; above him in the air; clambering from him by the ropes
    below; looking down upon him from the massive iron-girdered
    beams; peeping in upon him through the chinks and loopholes in
    the walls; spreading away and away from him in enlarging
    circles. He saw them of all aspects and all shapes. He saw them
    ugly, handsome, crippled, exquisitely formed. He saw them
    young, he saw them old; he saw them kind, he saw them cruel; he
    saw them merry, he saw them grim; he saw them dance, he heard
    them sing; he saw them tear their hair, he heard them howl. He
    saw the air thick with them.</p>

    <p><i>Wh-o-o-o-sh!</i> With what a wild whirr of startled wings
    the owls and bats scurried away, dim spectral hiding things
    that love the darkness and the silence of night, and shrink
    from light and cheerful sounds! "Well rid of <i>you</i>!"
    murmured <i>Punch</i>, as <i>Toby</i> barked at the flying
    phantoms.</p>

    <p>But among the other swarming sprites, and circling elfs, and
    frolic phantoms of the Bells, <i>Punch</i> beheld brighter
    things. That pleasant pair, hand in hand, princely-looking
    both, and loving withal, bring a music as of marriage-bells
    "all in the wild March morning." And those other goodly and
    gracious presences, hint they not of Health and Home Happiness,
    and Benignant Art, and Humanity-serving Science, of Electric
    Sympathy, and Ready Rescue, of Mammon-thwarting Reform, and
    Misery-staying Benevolence; of all the spiritual charities and
    fairy graces that can bless and brighten country and hearth,
    Sire and citizen, master and servant, employer and employed,
    struggling man, suffering woman and helpless child?
    <i>Punch</i> read in their whirling forms and expressive faces
    the signs and promise of all the best and brightest influences
    of the time, happy and opportune attendants upon the auspicious
    hour of this the opening day of the New Year!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Bim, Bom, Boom!!! Clang, Cling, Clang</i>!!! What are
    those hands tugging at the ropes, swinging the Bells big and
    little, evoking the stormy clashes and soothing cadences of the
    Chimes?</p>

    <p>Surely those of the youthful New Year himself! An echo from
    the long-silent lips of the great Christmas-glorifier and lover
    of poor humanity seemed to ring in <i>Punch's</i>
    ears:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Who hears in us, the Chimes, one note bespeaking disregard,
    or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> stern regard, of any hope, or
       joy or pain, or sorrow, of the many-sorrowed throng; who
       hears us make response to any creed that gauges human
       passions and affections, as it gauges the amount of
       miserable food on which humanity may pine and wither, does
       us wrong!"</p>

    <p>"Right you are!" cried <i>Punch</i>, cordially, <i>Toby</i>
    yapping assent.</p>

    <p>He might have said more, but the Bells, the dear familiar
    Bells, his own dear constant, steady friends, the Chimes, began
    to ring the joy-peals for a New Year so lustily, so merrily, so
    happily, so gaily, that he (like poor old <i>Trotty Veck</i>)
    leapt to his feet, and broke the spell that bound him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Yes, that is still the true Spirit of the Chimes," mused
    <i>Mr. Punch</i>, as he took pen in hand to open up his new
    Volume. "And that's the spirit I hope to keep up right through
    the twelve months of just-born Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-two,
    which I trust may be&mdash;with my willing assistance,</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>One of the Baron's Critical Faculty sends him his opinion of
    our Mr. DU MAURIER's latest novel, which is also his first. And
    here let it be published <i>urbi et orbi</i> that there is no
    truth whatever in a report which appeared in an evening paper
    to the effect that Mr. DU MAURIER, however retiring he may be,
    was about to retire or had retired from <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
    Staff. The <i>St. James's Gazette</i> has already
    "authoritatively" denied the assertion; and this denial the
    Baron for <i>Mr. Punch</i>, decisively confirms. Now, to the
    notice of the book above-mentioned. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/4-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/4-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"There has been a certain deliberateness in Mr. DU MAURIER's
    incursion into literature that speaks eloquently for his
    modesty. He is, to our certain knowledge, at least 40 years
    old, and <i>Peter Ibbetson</i>, which Messrs. OSGOOD &amp; CO.
    present in two daintily dressed volumes, is his first essay in
    romantic writing. Reading the book, it is hard to conceive this
    to be the fact. The work is entirely free from those traces of
    amateurishness, almost inseparable from a first effort. The
    literary style is considerably above the average modern
    novelist; the plot is marked by audacious invention, worked out
    with great skill; the hero is a madman, not in itself an
    attractive arrangement, but there is such admirable method in
    his madness, such fine poetic feeling in the conception of
    character, and the ghosts who flit through the pages of the
    story are so exceedingly human, that one feels quite at home
    with <i>Peter</i>, and is really sorry when, all too soon, his
    madness passes away, and he awakes to a new life, to find
    himself an old man. Apart from its strong dramatic interest,
    <i>Peter Ibbetson</i> has rare value, from the pictures of Old
    Paris in the last days of LOUIS-PHILIPPE, which crowd in
    charming succession through the first volume. Mr. GEORGE DU
    MAURIER, the well-known artist in black and white, has
    generously assisted Mr. GEORGE DU MAURIER, the rising novelist,
    by profusely illustrating the work. 'Tis a pretty rivalry; hard
    to say which has the better of it. Wherein a discerning Public,
    long familiar with DU MAURIER's sketches, will recognise a note

    <p>The Baron recommends Mrs. OLIPHANT's <i>The Railway Man and
    his Children</i>, which is a good story, with just such a dash
    of the improbable&mdash;but there, who can bring improbability
    as a charge against the plot constructed by any novelist after
    this great Jewel Case so recently tried? Mrs. OLIPHANT's types
    are well drawn; but the story is drawn out by just one volume
    too much. "For a one-volume novel commend me," quoth the Baron,
    "to Miss RHODA-BROUGHTON-CUM-ELIZABETH-BISLAND's <i>A Widower
    Indeed</i>. But ... wait till after the festivities are over to
    read it, as the tale is sad." <i>En attendant</i>, A Happy New

    <h3>FRANK AND THE FOX.</h3>

    <p>FRANK was a very studious and clever little boy.</p>

    <p>He took the keenest delight in music, and when he had
    mastered his lessons, he was very fond of playing on the
    concertina, and singing to his own accompaniment. He could
    already play "<i>The Bells go a-ringing for Sarah</i>!" with
    considerable finish and expression, and since his Uncle
    DODDLEWIG had presented him with half-a-crown for his
    performance, he had given the air with variations, and the song
    with every description of embellishment, all over the paternal
    mansion, and in most corners of the ancestral estate.</p>

    <p>To tell the truth, his family were getting somewhat tired of
    his continued asseverations concerning the tintinabulatory
    tribute everlastingly rendered to the excellent young woman.
    And had he not been so markedly encouraged by rich old Uncle
    DODDLEWIG, there is every reason to suppose that FRANK and his
    concertina would have been speedily suppressed.</p>

    <p>FRANK heard his Papa lamenting that foxes were so very
    scarce, that recently they had had no sport whatever. "There
    must be plenty of foxes in the country," said the Squire, "but
    they won't show."</p>

    <p>Now FRANK had been reading about Orpheus, and how he charmed
    all the wild beasts with his melody. It was true the boy had
    not a lyre, but he had no doubt that his concertina would do as
    well, and he was quite certain he had seen a fox while taking
    his rambles in Tippity Thicket,</p>

    <p>One day when he had a holiday, and his Papa had gone a
    hunting with his friends, he strolled off with his concertina
    to endeavour to lure a fox out into the open. He approached the
    hole where he had previously seen the fox, and sat down, and
    began to play vigorously on his concertina, and to sing at the
    top of his voice, "The Bells go a-ringing for <i>Say</i>-rah!
    <i>Say</i>-rah! <i>Say</i>-rah!" Presently he saw a huge Fox
    poke his nose out of the hole. He was delighted! He sang and
    played with renewed energy, and began to walk away, still
    singing and playing.</p>

    <p>The Fox followed, snarling, and snapping, and appearing very
    angry. The more he played, the more the Fox snarled and
    snapped. At last the animal became furious, all the hair on its
    back stood on end, and it began to make short runs with its
    mouth open at the young musician.</p>

    <p>It sprang upon him! He was terrified! He dropped his song
    and his concertina at the same moment, and scrambled up the
    nearest tree.</p>

    <p>The Fox's fury then knew no bounds; he trampled on the
    concertina, he bit it, he tore open the bellows, and having
    reduced it to a shapeless mass, bore it away to his hole.</p>

    <p>When the coast was quite clear, FRANK descended, and slunk
    home.</p>

    <p>The next morning one of the keepers found a dead fox. It had
    apparently died of suffocation, as sixteen ivory
    concertina-stops were found in its throat.</p>

    <p>FRANK now has entirely ceased to believe in Ancient
    Mythology, and has been even heard to hint that he considers
    Dr. LEMPRIÈRE a bit of a humbug.</p>

    <p>Two days ago I chanced, for no special reason, to open the
    drawers of an old writing-table, which for years past had
    stood, unused, in a corner of an upper room. In one I found a
    rusty screw, in another a couple of dusty envelopes, in a third
    a piece of sealing-wax, half-a-dozen nibs, and a broken pencil.
    The fourth, and last drawer, was very stiff. For a long time it
    defied my efforts, and it was only by a great exertion of
    strength that I was at last able to wrench it open. To my
    surprise I saw two packets of letters, tied together with faded
    ribbon. I took them up, and then remembered, with a start, what
    they were. They were all in their envelopes, and all were
    addressed, in the same hand-writing, to Sir CHARLES CALLENDER,
    Bart., Curzon Street, Mayfair. They were his wife's letters,
    and, after the death of Sir CHARLES, whose sole executor I was,
    they came into my possession,&mdash;Sir CHARLES, for some
    inscrutable reason, never having destroyed them, although,
    after his wife's death, the reading of them cannot have given
    him much pleasure. No doubt I ought to have destroyed them. I
    had never read them; but there, in that forgotten drawer, they
    had lain, the silent dust accumulating upon them as the years
    rolled on. They reminded me of the story I am about to
    relate&mdash;a story of which, I think, no one except myself
    has guessed the truth, and which, in most of its details, I
    only knew from a paper, carefully closed, heavily sealed, and
    addressed to me, which I found amongst my friend's documents.
    It was in his hand-writing throughout, but I shall tell it in
    my own words, and in my own way.</p>

    <p>Nobody who was about in London Society some thirty years
    ago, could fail to know or know about the beautiful Lady
    CALLENDER. She was of a good county family. She was clever and
    accomplished. She had married a man rich, generous, amiable,
    and cultivated, who adored her. Unfortunately they had no
    children, but, in every other respect, Lady CALLENDER seemed to
    be very justly an object of envy and admiration to most of the
    men and women of her circle. Personally I had no great liking
    for her. I don't take any credit for that&mdash;far from it.
    The reason may have been that her Ladyship (although I was one
    of her husband's best friends, had been his school chum, and
    had "kept" with him in the same set of rooms at Cambridge,
    where his triumphs, physical and intellectual, are still
    remembered) never much cared for me. She could dissemble her
    real feelings better than any woman I ever knew, she always
    greeted me with a smile, she even made a parade of taking my
    advice on little family difficulties, but there was an
    indefinable something in her manner which convinced me that
    beneath all her smiles she bore me no good-will. The fact is
    that, without any design on my part, I had detected her in one
    or two bits of trickery, and, in what I suppose I must call her
    heart of hearts, she never forgave me. The truth is, though her
    guileless husband only knew it too late, she was perhaps the
    trickiest and the most heartless woman in England. If there
    were two roads to the attainment of any object, the one
    straight, broad, smooth and short, the other round-about,
    obscure, narrow and encompassed with pitfalls and beset by
    difficulties, she would deliberately choose the latter for no
    other reason that I could ever see except that by treading it
    she might be able to deceive her friends as to her true
    direction. She carried to a fine art the small intrigues, the
    petty jealousies, the mean manoeuvres in the science of
    outwitting; the shifts, the stratagems, the evasions by which
    power in Society is often supposed to be confirmed, reputations
    are frequently ruined, and lives are almost invariably made
    wretched. But Sir CHARLES knew none of these things. He was
    apparently only too proud to be dragged at his wife's
    chariot-wheels in her triumphant progress. For the strange part
    of the business is that there was absolutely no need for any of
    her deeply-laid schemes. Success, popularity and esteem would
    have come to her readily without them. She was, as I said,
    beautiful. Innocence seemed to be throned on her fresh and
    glowing face. Her smile fascinated, her voice was a poem, and
    she was musical in the best sense of the word at a time when
    good music, although it might lack popular support, could
    always command a small band of enthusiastic votaries in
    London.</p>

    <p>There was at this time living in London an Italian artist,
    man of letters and musical <i>virtuoso</i>, who was the spoiled
    darling of Society. All the women raved about him, the men
    liked him, for he had fought bravely on the field of battle,
    was a sportsman and had about him that frank and abundant
    <i>gaieté de coeur</i>, which powerfully attracts the less
    exuberant Englishman. For his part CASANUOVA (that was his
    name) bore all his successes with good-nature and without
    swagger. Of course there were whispers about him. Where so many
    women worshipped, it was certain that two or three would lose
    their heads. Amongst this limited number was little Mrs.
    MILLETT, one of Lady CALLENDER's most intimate friends. She
    made no secret of her <i>grande passion</i>. She poured her
    tale into the ears of Lady CALLENDER, and asked for sympathy
    and help. Lady CALLENDER promised both, and at the self-same
    moment, made up her mind that she would withdraw from Mrs.
    MILLETT such affection as CASANUOVA had honoured her with, and
    bring him, not because she cared for him, but merely for the
    sport of the thing, to her own feet. She succeeded admirably.
    Under the pretence of bringing CASANUOVA and Mrs. MILLETT
    together (such things, you know, have been done in good
    Society) she invited him constantly to her house; she gave
    musical parties in his honour, she used all her fascinations,
    and finally, having fooled Ariadne to the top of her bent, she
    captured Theseus, and bore him off.</p>

    <p>Mrs. MILLETT was a foolish and frivolous little woman. Rage
    and despair made her a demon. She resolved on revenge, and
    proceeded to it with a cool and astonishing persistency. Now I
    do not myself believe that Lady CALLENDER cared two straws
    about CASANUOVA. What she aimed at and enjoyed was the
    discomfiture of a friend. In order to obtain it, however, she
    committed a fatal imprudence. She wrote some letters which
    would have convinced even a French jury of her guilt. By a
    master-stroke of cunning wickedness, Mrs. MILLETT gained
    possession of them, and sent them to Sir CHARLES. It happened
    that about this time Sir CHARLES was in a very low state of
    health, and his friends were anxious about him. One afternoon,
    when Sir CHARLES was confined to his bed, Lady CALLENDER was
    playing the piano to her Italian slave. A message was brought
    to her that her husband desired to see her for a few minutes,
    and she tripped gaily away, saying to CASANUOVA, "Wait here; I
    shall return directly." In a quarter of an hour, however, her
    maid came to tell him that her Ladyship was suffering, and
    begged him to excuse her, and he departed. When the maid
    returned to Lady CALLENDER, she found her lying dead on the
    floor of her room, with a small phial, which had contained
    prussic acid, clasped tightly in her hand.</p>

    <p>This is what had happened: Sir CHARLES had received the
    letters; they left no doubt in his mind that the wife he adored
    was betraying him, and he, too, resolved on revenge. He sent
    for his wife. When she came in, he at once confronted her with
    her letters, and taxed her with her guilt. A terrible scene of
    tears, entreaties, and bitter reproaches ensued, but Sir
    CHARLES was as adamant, and his wife retired to her bedroom in
    a state of nervous prostration, which immediately brought on a
    toothache. At this point she sent for her maid, and gave her
    the message to CASANUOVA.</p>

    <p>The Coroner was sympathetic, and did what he could, but the
    evidence in favour of the suicide theory seemed overwhelming,
    and the jury returned a verdict to this effect, with a rider
    strongly commenting on the danger of selling such deadly
    poisons. But it was never explained how Lady CALLENDER obtained
    the prussic acid, nor why she had selected that particular
    moment for its use. I ought to add, that CASANUOVA left England
    before the inquest, and has never returned. On the mystery of
    the final catastrophe the manuscript throws no light. It ends
    abruptly. But the whole tone of it leads me to believe, that in
    some unexplained manner Sir CHARLES himself had been
    instrumental in causing his wife's death. But you, no doubt,
    know, and could tell us if you wished.</p>

    <p>So there, my friend, you have the story. Sorry I couldn't
    make it more cheerful. Do you remember the part you played in
    it?</p>

        Canal</i>, CULCHARD <i>is leaning upon the
        balustrade.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podbury</i>. Yes, met BOB just now. They've gone to the
    Europa, but we've arranged to take a gondola together, and go
    about. They're to pick me up here. Ah, that looks rather like
    them. (<i>A gondola approaches, with</i> Miss PRENDERGAST
    <i>and</i> BOB; PODBURY <i>goes down the steps to meet
    them.</i>) How are you, Miss PRENDERGAST? Here I <i>am</i>, you
    see.</p>

        </a>"I guess you want to Cologne <i>your</i> cheeks!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Miss Prendergast</i>t (<i>ignoring C.'s salute</i>). How
    do you do, Mr. PODBURY? Surely you don't propose to go out in a
    gondola in <i>that</i> hat!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>taking off a brown "pot-hat," and
    inspecting it</i>). It&mdash;it's quite <i>decent</i>. It was
    new when I came away!</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i> (<i>who is surly this morning</i>). Hang it all,
    'PATIA! Do you want him to come out in a chimney-pot? Jump in,
    old fellow; never mind your tile?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>apologetically</i>). I had a straw
    one&mdash;but I sat on it. I'm awfully sorry, Miss PRENDERGAST.
    Look here, shall I go and see if I can buy one?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> Not now&mdash;it doesn't signify, for once.
    But around hat and a gondola are really <i>too</i>
    incongruous!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Are they? A lot of the Venetians seem to wear
    'em. (<i>He steps in</i>.) Now what are we going to
    do&mdash;just potter about?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> One hardly comes to Venice to <i>potter</i>!
    I thought we'd go and study the Carpaccios at the Church of the
    Schiavoni first&mdash;they won't take us more than an hour or
    so; then cross to San Giorgio Maggiore, and see the Tintorets,
    come back and get a general idea of the exterior of St. Mark's,
    and spend the afternoon at the Accademia.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with a slight absence of heartiness</i>).
    Capital! And&mdash;er&mdash;lunch at the Academy, I
    suppose?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> There does not happen to be a restaurant
    there&mdash;we shall see what time we have. I must say <i>I</i>
    regard every minute of daylight spent on food here as a sinful
    waste.</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. Now just look here, 'PATIA, if you <i>are</i>
    bossing this show, you needn't go cutting us off our grub! What
    do <i>you</i> say, JEM?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>desperately anxious to please</i>). Oh, I
    don't know that I care about lunch myself&mdash;much.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Their voices die away on the water.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>musing</i>). She might have <i>bowed</i>
    to me!... <i>She</i> has escaped the mosquitoes.... Ah, well, I
    doubt if she'll find those two particularly sympathetic
    companions! Now I <i>should</i> enjoy a day spent in that way.
    Why shouldn't I, as it is? I daresay MAUD will&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Turns and sees</i> Mr. TROTTER.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> My darter will be along presently. She's
    Cologning her cheeks&mdash;they've swelled up again some. I
    guess you want to Cologne <i>your</i> cheeks&mdash;they're
    dreadful lumpy. I've just been on the Pi-azza again, Sir. It's
    curious now the want of enterprise in these Vernetians. Anyone
    would have expected they'd have thrown a couple or so of
    girder-bridges across the canal between this and the Ri-alto,
    and run an elevator up the Campanile&mdash;but this ain't what
    you might call a <i>business</i> city, Sir, and that's a fact.
    (<i>To</i> Miss T. <i>as she appears</i>.) Hello, MAUD, the
    ice-water cool down your face any?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Not <i>much</i>. My face just made that
    ice-water boil over. I don't believe I'll ever have a
    complexion again&mdash;it's divided up among several dozen
    mosquitoes, who've no use for one. But it's vurry consoling to
    look at <i>you</i>, Mr. CULCHARD, and feel there's a pair of
    us. Now what way do you propose we should endeavor to forget
    our sufferings?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, we might spend the morning in St.
    Mark's&mdash;?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> The morning! Why, Poppa and I saw the entire
    show I inside of ten minutes, before breakfast!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Ah! (<i>Discouraged.</i>) What do you say to
    studying the Vine and Fig-tree angles and the capitals of the
    arcades in the Ducal Palace? I will go and fetch the <i>Stones
    of Venice</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess you can leave those old stones in
    peace. I don't feel like studying up anything this
    morning&mdash;it's as much as ever I can do not to scream
    aloud!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Then shall we just drift about in a gondola
    all the morning, and&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps do the Academy
    later?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Not any canals in this hot sun for me! I'd be
    just as <i>sick</i>! That gondola will keep till it's
    cooler.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>losing patience</i>). Then I must really
    leave it to you to make a suggestion!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I believe I'll have a good look round
    the curiosity stores. There's ever such a cunning little shop
    back of the Clock Tower on the Pi-azza, where I saw some
    brocades that were just too sweet! So I'll take Poppa along
    bargain-hunting. Don't <i>you</i> come if you'd rather poke
    around your old churches and things!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I don't feel disposed to&mdash;er&mdash;"poke
    around" alone; so, if you will allow me to accompany
    you,&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Oh, I'll allow you to escort me. It's handy
    having someone around to carry parcels. And Poppa's bound to
    drop the balance every time!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). That's all I am to her. A
    beast of burden! And a whole precious morning squandered on
    this confounded shopping&mdash;when I might have been&mdash;ah,
    well! [<i>Follows, under protest.</i></p>

    <p><i>On the Grand Canal. 9 P.M. A brilliant moonlight night; a
    music-barge, hung with coloured lanterns, is moving slowly up
    towards the Rialto, surrounded and followed by a fleet of
    gondolas, amongst which is one containing the</i> TROTTERS
    <i>and</i> CULCHARD. CULCHARD <i>has just discovered&mdash;with
    an embarrassment not wholly devoid of a certain
    excitement&mdash;that they are drawing up to a gondola occupied
    by the</i> PRENDERGASTS <i>and</i> PODBURY.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Trotter</i> (<i>meditatively</i>). It's real
    romantic. That's the third deceased kitten I've seen to-night.
    They haven't only a two-foot tide in the Adriatic, and it
    stands to reason all the sewage&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The two gondolas are jammed close alongside.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> How absolutely magical those palaces look in
    the moonlight! BOB, how <i>can</i> you yawn like that?</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. I beg your pardon, 'PATIA, really, but we've had
    rather a long day of it, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well, now, I declare I sort of recognised
    those voices! (<i>Heartily.</i>) Why, how are <i>you</i>
    getting along in Vernis? <i>We</i>'re gettin' along fust-rate.
    Say, MAUD, here's your friend alongside!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Miss P. <i>preserves a stony silence.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>in an undertone</i>). I don't see how you
    <i>can</i> act so, Poppa&mdash;when you know she's just as
    <i>mad</i> with me!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> There! Electrocuted if I didn't clean forget
    you were out! But, see here, now&mdash;why cann't we let
    bygones be bygones?</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. (<i>impulsively</i>). Just what <i>I</i> think,
    Mr. TROTTER, and I'm sure my sister will&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> BOB, will you kindly not make the situation
    more awkward than it is? If I desired a reconciliation, I think
    I am quite capable of saying so!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>in confidence to the Moon</i>). This Ark
    isn't proposing to send out any old dove, either&mdash;we've no
    use for an olive-branch. (<i>To</i> Mr. T.) That's "<i>Santa
    Lucia</i>" they're singing now, Poppa.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> They don't appear to me to get the twist on it
    they did at Bellagio!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> You mean that night CHARLEY took us out on
    the Lake? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> Poor CHARLEY! he'd just love
       to be here&mdash;he's ever so much artistic feeling!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well, I don't see why he couldn't have come
    along if he'd wanted.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>with a glance at her neighbour</i>). I
    presume he'd reasons enough. He's a vurry cautious man. Likely
    he was afraid he'd get bitten.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>after a swift scrutiny of</i> Miss T.'s
    <i>features</i>). Oh, BOB, remind me to get some more of that
    mosquito stuff. I <i>should</i> so hate to be bitten&mdash;such
    a <i>dreadful</i> disfigurement!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>to the Moon</i>). I declare if I don't
    believe I can feel some creature trying to sting me now!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> Some people are hardly recognisable, BOB, and
    they say the marks never <i>quite</i> disappear!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Poppa, don't you wonder what CHARLEY's doing
    just now? I'd like to know if he's found anyone yet to feel an
    interest in the great Amurrcan Novel. It's curious how
    interested people do get in that novel, considering it's none
    of it written, and never will be. I guess sometimes he makes
    them believe he means something by it. They don't understand
    it's only CHARLEY's way!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> The crush isn't quite so bad now. Mr.
    PODBURY, if you will kindly ask your friend not to hold on to
    our gondola, we should probably be better able to turn.
    (CULCHARD, <i>who had fondly imagined himself undetected, takes
    his hand away as if it were scorched.</i>) Now we can get away.
    (<i>To</i> Gondolier.) Voltiamo, se vi piace, prestissimo!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The gondola turns and departs.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I do just enjoy making PRENDERGAST girl
    perfectly wild, and that's a fact. (<i>Reflectively.</i>) And
    it's queer, but I like her ever so much all the time. Don't
    <i>you</i> think that's too fonny of me, Mr. CULCHARD, now?</p>

    <p>We are supplied by our special reporter with some
    interesting and significant facts in connection with the last
    Cabinet Council. Lord SALISBUY arrived early, walking over from
    the Foreign Office under cover of an umbrella. The fact that it
    was raining may only partly account for this manoeuvre. Lord
    CROSS arrived in a four-wheeled cab and wore his spectacles.
    Lord KNUTSFORD approached the Treasury walking on the left hand
    side of the road going westward, whilst Lord CRANBROOK
    deliberately chose the pavement on the other side of the way.
    This is regarded as indicating a coolness between the Colonial
    Office and the Council of Education. Lord HALSBURY alighted
    from a bus at the bottom of Downing Street, accomplishing the
    rest of the journey on foot. He wore a new suit of the latest
    fashionable cut and a smile. Mr. STANHOPE, approaching Downing
    Street from the steps, started violently when he caught sight
    of a figure on the steps of the Treasury fumbling with the
    door-handle. He thought it was "VETUS," but recognising the
    Home Secretary, advanced without further hesitation. Lord
    GEORGE HAMILTON walked arm-in-arm as far as the door with Sir
    M. HICKS-BEACH. Here they were observed to hastily relieve
    themselves from contiguity and enter in single file. As they
    had up to that moment been engaged in earnest conversation,
    this little incident caused a sensation among the crowd looking
    on. The new Chief Secretary was easily recognised as he
    descended from his hansom with a sprig of shamrock in his coat
    and another of shillelagh in his right hand. Whilst waiting for
    change out of eighteenpence he softly whistled "<i>God Save
    Ireland</i>." Mr. RITCHIE did not appear, pleading influenza.
    Our reporter informs us that there is more behind, and that
    before the Session is far advanced a change may be looked for
    at the Local Government Board.</p>

    <p><i>Judge</i> (<i>mysteriously handing note to Bar engaged in

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
